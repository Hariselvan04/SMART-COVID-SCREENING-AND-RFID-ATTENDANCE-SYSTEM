# SMART-COVID-SCREENING-AND-RFID-ATTENDANCE-SYSTEM
RC522 RFID module is used as a biometric, the people can enter into the respective premises using the RFID cards which will be counted as attendance. The next stage this system is temperature checker which will be done by contactless temperature sensor (MLX90614), in order to measure the range for the temperature sensor Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04) is used.  After the RFID stage the people have to put their finger just above the contactless temperature sensor to check their temperature. If their temperature is normal, they are allowed to go to the next stage, if the temperature is not normal, they are asked to not enter the premises. The last stage of this system is to measure blood oxygen and heart rate levels, to do this pulse oximeter (MAX30100) is used and the readings of the pulse oximeter will be displayed in OLED. After the intermediate stage, the people are asked to put their finger on the pulse oximeter, same as intermediate stage the people are allowed to enter the premises only if their blood oxygen and heart rate levels are normal.
